# NextWordPredictionModel
This GitHub repository hosts a machine learning project that utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to generate text based on the stories of Sherlock Holmes. The model is trained on a plain text file containing various Sherlock Holmes stories, learning to predict the next words in a sequence given a seed text.
